trepidation (trepidation)	1) As the Sovereign recites her sentence, as the Jackal waits to deliver it, as Mustang kneels on the ground, as Cassius watches me from among the Praetorians and Knights, waiting, and as Aja sees me look to the tall blond knight, she steps forward in <b><u>trepidation</u></b> because she knows something is wrong, I throw my head back and I howl.  <br>2) He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind’s resistance rather than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great <b><u>trepidation</u></b>, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years. — CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE — The Beetle at Bay Harry’s question was answered the very next morning.  <br>3) ‘No,’ said Harry curtly, then, ‘let’s keep looking,’ and he turned away, wishing he had not seen the stone: he did not want his excited <b><u>trepidation</u></b> tainted with resentment.  <br>4) ‘Well, well,’ said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of <b><u>trepidation</u></b> in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official.  <br>5) “No shooter or bomb,” the young one says, still not seeing the older one’s <b><u>trepidation</u></b>.  <br>6) I wait in <b><u>trepidation</u></b>.  <br>7) To not quiver in primal <b><u>trepidation</u></b> at the thought of invasion, to not let your senators hoard your wealth for themselves and hide behind your ships of war, but to summon the more wrathful angels of their spirits and send forth the might of the Republic to scourge the engines of tyranny and oppression from the Mercurian sky and rescue our Free Legions.”  <br>8) To not quiver in primal <b><u>trepidation</u></b> at the thought of invasion, to not let your senators hoard your wealth for themselves and hide behind your ships of war, but to summon the more wrathful angels of their spirits and send forth the might of the Republic to scourge the engines of tyranny and oppression from the Mercurian sky and rescue our Free Legions.”  <br>9) “All this <b><u>trepidation</u></b> is giving me cankers,” she says.  <br>		91

the (the)	1) I discovered from eavesdropping that half of <b><u>the</u></b> powerful Golds in here were called to Sungrave from <b><u>the</u></b>ir own mountain cities or moons before <b><u>the</u></b> coup began, under <b><u>the</u></b> false auspices of an emergency summons sent out by Dido under Romulus’s warrant.  <br>2) Which is not in <b><u>the</u></b> schematics.  <br>3) For <b><u>the</u></b> Elves of <b><u>the</u></b> High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and <b><u>the</u></b>y dwelt still at that time at <b><u>the</u></b> Grey Havens away to <b><u>the</u></b> west, and in o<b><u>the</u></b>r places within reach of <b><u>the</u></b> Shire.  <br>4) The o<b><u>the</u></b>rs followed his example, putting <b><u>the</u></b>ir packs against <b><u>the</u></b> bank and <b><u>the</u></b>ir legs out into <b><u>the</u></b> road.  <br>5) All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and <b><u>the</u></b> wall <b><u>the</u></b> likeliest chance.  <br>6) In <b><u>the</u></b> twilight he saw a large black Orc, probably Uglúk, standing facing Grishnákh, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to <b><u>the</u></b> ground.  <br>7) The hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing <b><u>the</u></b>m in <b><u>the</u></b>ir helplessness – little squeaking ghosts that wandered among <b><u>the</u></b> ash-heaps of <b><u>the</u></b> Dark Lord.  <br>8) So at length <b><u>the</u></b>y came to <b><u>the</u></b> private chamber of <b><u>the</u></b> Lord of <b><u>the</u></b> City.  <br>		81
